Timesheet

11/19/2016:
    2 hours – downloading, setting up, and working panda3d and blender
    3 hours – competitive analysis, storyboard, project proposal
11/20/2016:
    3 hours – watching tutorials of how to use panda3d in basics
    3 hours – understanding provided demos and tutorials downloaded with panda3d
    2 hours – understanding blender uses… creating the maze and jewels
    2 hours – trying to make Yabee work (but to no avail)
11/21/2016:
    4 hours – coding to create the maze and adjust the camera (player position) as desired… 
coded to add randomly chosen and placed jewels in the maze, and accounts for if the player gets the jewel
11/28/2016:
    8 hours – worked on randomly generating the maze in 3 ways. Was able to randomly generate, but not make a legal maze (a maze with a path). Found a way, but it had a recursion of maximum depth.    
11/29/2016:
    9 hours – After playing with the created mazes from yesterday, I tried 3 different ways to create the maze. 2 of them worked on small boards… 4by4 and 5by5… Large boards called the recursive function to maximum recursion depths. Found a new way to approach randomly generating the maze(which I will do the next day). I also started creating the various screenmodes for the UI. I also configured the given panda3d files to make panda3d and tkinter work together so that I could use tkinter for all my screens, except for the game mode.  
11/30/2016:
    6 hours – various screenmodes and creating the maze in yet another approach for it to function with larger dimensions
12/1/2016:
    3 hours – worked with the game mode and graphics and list of the board (options bar, jewel box)
12/2/2016:
    5 hours – worked with the game and coded the logic (when, where, and how to create plants, the zombies creating itself with random intervals)
12/3/2016: 
    12 hours – worked on creating the “shooters”, what shoots out of each plant and moving each shooter (to actually shoot the zombie or not), worked with collisions of the shooters with zombies  
12/4/2016:
    10 hours – images on all screens, and locations. Bugs in creating the zombies, where they belong, their intervals, the number of them.
12/5/2016: 
    5 hours – worked with the game to incorporate levels (changes the number of zombies, intervals between timer created aspects such as walnut explosions)
12/6/2016:
    10 hours – fixing bugs!! Of movement of the shooters, collisions, recreating of the shooters (essentially the class information for everything)
12/7/2016:
    10 hours – worked on walnut explosions with the L algorithm, and making the peashooters move in the y direction as well with gravity
    2 hours – creating the deliverables
12/8/2016:
    3 hours – Working on setting the zombies on fire with the recursive L algorithm fractal method and making the peashooters move in the y direction as well with gravity bugs
